# Final Testing Assignment

This assignment revolves around **automatic test code generation**. In it, you will use EvoSuite on one or multiple Java programs. 
We are interested in understanding your experiences with automatic test code generation in the broad sense. But, specifically,
we want you to experience and understand the strong points and weak points of automatic test code generation.

Therefore, download and familiarise yourself with EvoSuite. http://www.evosuite.org
Try it out and look at the tests that are generated. Seed faults on purpose and see what the tests do and how helpful 
(or not) they are. Just to be clear: there is no right/wrong answer, as each situation is unique. We are looking for how
thoroughly you analyse and explain the situation.

You have to create a video in which you use e.g. slides + voice over to show and explain what you did. 
We are expecting at least the following, but feel free to be creative and highlight other things as well!
   * Which projects you selected and why
   * Which issues you had when running EvoSuite
   * Which faults you seeded (manual / mutation testing / ...)
   * How easy/difficult it was to:
      * Detect the seeded fault
      * Diagnose the seeded fault
   * Think of the following literature to consult and relate your experiences with these scientific studies:
      * Automatic test case generation: what if test code quality matters? https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2931037.2931057
      * A detailed investigation of the effectiveness of whole test suite generation https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10664-015-9424-2
      * Does Automated Unit Test Generation Really Help Software Testers? A Controlled Empirical Study https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2699688
      * Disposable testing: avoiding maintenance of generated unit tests by throwing them away https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3098414

Your video will be evaluated on the following criteria:
   * Clarity of presentation
   * Quality of observations
   * Quality of argumentation (e.g., how can the observations be explained) 
   * Quality of the argumentation when comparing with Inozemtseva (see: http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2635868.2635929)
   
You can get extra credit when you highlight other interesting insights that youâ€™ve generated while performing this study.

**Aim for a presentation between 5 and 10 minutes.**

You will need to upload the presentation to Youtube. Remember to make the presentation private. You will get a link to a website to register your Youtube URL later on.
